# ODE_Solver_nn
This is a quick notebook I did to try and experiment with the Lagaris method for resolving ODEs with neural networks. I also added some techniques used in Flamant et al to speed up the learning rate. 

Every comment is made in French but a translation can be made if needed.

Here is the paper I wrote explaining the technique used.

References and inspirations are at the end of the notebook.
